## About

The [Baleen](https://github.com/bbengfort/baleen) ingestion tool is used to create a corpus of web articles and blogs from RSS feeds. Minke extends Baleen with a library to perform text analysis and perform graph extraction on the exported corpora.

Baleen means &ldquo;whale bone&rdquo; and particularly refers to the straining bones that whales of the mysticeti suborder have. These bones filter food from water as the Baleen ingestion engine filters content from the web. [Minke whales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minke_whale) are a specific species of [rorqual whales](https://seaworld.org/Animal-Info/Animal-InfoBooks/Baleen-Whales/Scientific-Classification), one of the shortest in fact. This library is named to indicate it's a short version of the larger Baleen codebase.
